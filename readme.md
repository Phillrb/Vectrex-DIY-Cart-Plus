# Vectrex DIY Cart+

An extension to the Vectrex multicart 'DIY Cart+' by Alan Leverett that adds:

- Scrolling ROM names
- Improved Arduino code

The mutlicart promotes tinkering and exploring hardware-based bankswitching of ROMs via an Arduino Nano.
You are encouraged to change the code, and create your own EPROM images.
This GitHub repo does not itself include any ROM images for the EPROM.

For instructions on printing, assembing and programming, see links below:
